# Solana Wallet Profiler

This project is a **Solana Wallet Profiler** that uses a **React frontend**, a **Python backend**, and the **Solana blockchain** to analyze wallet activity and perform AI-driven clustering of Solana wallet users. The system fetches wallet data (like balance, NFT trades, and transactions) from the Solana network and provides a user interface to analyze the wallet's activity.

## Features
- **Connect a Solana Wallet**: Integrate with Solana wallets using the Solflare Wallet extension.
- **Fetch Wallet Balance**: Get the balance of any Solana wallet.
- **AI Wallet Analysis**: Perform AI-driven clustering and profiling based on wallet activity.
- **Add Wallet Activity**: Simulate wallet activity (NFT trades, token holdings, transactions) and submit it for analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Solana**: Blockchain for decentralized applications.
- **Solflare Wallet**: Solana wallet extension for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **FastAPI**: Python backend for providing APIs and connecting to the Solana blockchain.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for clustering wallet activity.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API calls between frontend and backend.
